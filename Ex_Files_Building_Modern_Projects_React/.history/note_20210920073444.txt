_support for ES6
_webpack
_Root component (container that holds the rest of the application)
_react-hot-loader

(Redux Store)
Redux Store is essentially a big J-son object that serves as the single source of truth for all of our components. 

(Redux Actions)
Redux actions are j-son objects, consisting of two things, an action type, which is basically just a string naming the action, and a payload of additional data. The purpose of redux actions, is to explicitly define the different events that can occur in our application.

(key point)
our components are only allowed to make changes to the state by triggering a predefined actions and the only changes to the state that are allowed to take place in our application are the corresponding changes that we specify in our reducers. This all gives rise to what's referred to as unidirectional data flow.

In other words, we end up with a cycle that looks something like this: the UI triggers an action, that action is reduced to get the new updated state, and the components in our application get read only access to that updated state.

Steps to add redux
    _run "npm install redux react-redux"
    _create store.js in "src" directory and (...write some code...)
    _in index.js
    _.....import { Provider } from "react-redux";
    _.....import { configureStore } from "./store";
    _.....<Provider store={configureStore()}> <App /> </Provider>

npm install redux-persist
