## MVP
1. A small business owner can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.
2.  They can also make listing for items they want to sell, which will show up to all users.
3.   They add a new item by selecting their market location and typing in their item's name, description, and price.

## Stretch
A business owner can upload their picture to their profile.
